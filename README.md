### Mobile Edge AI Systems

Along with the rapid development of AI and deep learning, DNN models have been widely used in various applications. However, the high computational comlexity of DNN models makes it difficult to deploy them on mobile and edge devices with limited computing resources. This repo collects the research works presenting a system that can efficiently execute DNN models on mobile and edge devices.
